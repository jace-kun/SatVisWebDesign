              <p class="Manwei-Bio">Manwei is the project lead for the satellite visualizer. He is also an NSF Fellow and PhD Candidate in Aerospace Engineering at MIT, studying responsive, remote sensing satellite constellations. He wants to mature the commercial space ecosystem, eventually allowing more people and projects to utilize space. Manwei decided to pursue this particular satellite visualizer to help make his research more accessible to the general public. Outside of academics he is involved with STEM outreach, organizing the MIT Space Seminar, MIT SpaceTech, and SGAC Fusion Forum, events geared toward young professionals and designed to inspire future generations of space enthusiasts. In his free time, he likes to ski, hike, and play football (soccer).</p>
